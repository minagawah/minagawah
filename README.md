### Hi there üëã

Hi, this is Mina. I live in Japan :japan: :shinto_shrine: :sushi: and I practice martial arts :octocat:. I love Rust! :crab:  
I usually create repos for my own benefit :avocado:, but I hope you will find them helpful to you as well! :seedling: :flamingo:  
I am currently **looking for a job opening starting mid-February 2025 in HCMC, Vietnam!**

**[solid-principles-crockford](https://github.com/minagawah/solid-principles-crockford)** (2024)  
Samples to demonstrate applying SOLID principles to FP codes.  
:pushpin: `SOLID principles` &middot; `FP` &middot; `Crockford`  

**[rust-wasm-canvas-example](https://github.com/minagawah/rust-wasm-canvas-example)** (2024)  
The latest attempt for WASM app with Canvas API. The structure is much simpler than [perlin-experiment](https://github.com/minagawah/perlin-experiment) or [perlin-experiment-2](https://github.com/minagawah/perlin-experiment-2).  
Using `wasm-pack-plugin`. A good starter for using WASM for canvas animations.  
:pushpin: `Rust` &middot; `wasm-pack` &middot; `wasm-bindgen` &middot; `js-sys` &middot; `web-sys` &middot; `wasm-pack-plugin`  

**[very-simple-wasm-2023](https://github.com/minagawah/very-simple-wasm-2023)**  
Probably, the simplest example to get started with WASM apps.  
Other WASM samples contain canvas animation examples, but this one only tell you how to wire your JS app with WASM.    
:pushpin: `Rust` &middot; `wasm-pack` &middot; `wasm-bindgen` &middot; `js-sys` &middot; `web-sys` &middot; `wasm-pack-plugin`

**[sowngwala-js](https://github.com/minagawah/sowngwala-js)** (2024)  
JS library for calculating sun and moon's position ported from [sowngwala](https://github.com/minagawah/sowngwala/) written in Rust.  
:pushpin: `Sun's Position` &middot; `Astrology` &middot; `Astronomy` &middot; `JS`  
[:eyes: View Demo](https://tokyo800.jp/mina/sowngwala/)  

**[sowngwala](https://github.com/minagawah/sowngwala)** (2021)  
A library for calculating sun's position.  
_"sowng"_ stands for "sun" in
[Belter language](https://expanse.fandom.com/wiki/Belter_Creole) (from sci-fi movie "The Expanse").  
_"wala"_ for _"one who is professional at"_.  
:pushpin: `Rust`

**[mikaboshi](https://github.com/minagawah/mikaboshi)** (2021)  
A Rust library for È¢®Ê∞¥ (È£éÊ∞¥) (Feng-Shui) providing basic Chinese astrological concepts such as ÂÖ´Âç¶ (Ba-Gua), Âπ≤ÊîØ (Gan-Zhi), ‰πùÊòü (Jiu-Xing), ‰∫åÂçÅÂõõËäÇÊ∞î (Er-Shi-Si Jie-Qi), ‰∫åÂçÅÂõõÂ±±Âêë (Er-Shi-Si Shan-Xiang), ÁîüÊ≠ªË°∞Êó∫ (Sheng-Si Shuai-Wang), etc. When bundled into a WASM (WebAssembly) app, you could associate the library with your Javascript apps as well.    
:pushpin: `Rust`

**[perlin-experiment-2](https://github.com/minagawah/perlin-experiment-2)** (2023)  
Another attempt in using Perlin noise. Last time, only the noise calculation was done in WASM, and a canvas animation was done in JS. This time, everything is done in WASM. To better serve as an introductory WASM sample app, I made the codes as simple as possible.  
Highlights: (1) Spawns a child process for animation, (2) Event listener for browser resize event, and (2) `debounce` to limit executions when resize happens.

**[perlin-experiment](https://github.com/minagawah/perlin-experiment)** (2021)  
This WASM app creates canvas elements for 2 divs, and runs animations.
The WASM app is one, but handles 2 canvas elements.
You may pass configs at initial startup.
Clicking the upper canvas, you may toggle among 3 visualization modes.
If you are only interested in Perlin Noise,
see my JS project `perlin-noise-world-map` (which is quite old) which auto-generates geographic landscapes
([source](https://github.com/minagawah/perlin-noise-worldmap)
or [demo](http://tokyo800.jp/minagawah/perlin-noise-worldmap/)).
Or, see `rust-perlin-wasm-test-2` (which is even much older) for particles moving in organic manner
([source](https://github.com/minagawah/rust-perlin-wasm-test-2)
or [demo](http://tokyo800.jp/minagawah/rust-perlin-wasm-test-2/)).
