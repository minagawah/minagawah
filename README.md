### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- [perlin-experiment](https://github.com/minagawah/perlin-experiment)  
Using `wasm-pack` to bind an ordinary Webpack project with a WASM app.
For 2 divs in HTML, the WASM app creates canvas elements, and runs animations.
If you are only interested only in "perlin noise", you may find
[this old JS project](https://github.com/minagawah/perlin-noise-worldmap) of mine interesting,
or its [demo](http://tokyo800.jp/minagawah/perlin-noise-worldmap/) for auto-generating landscapes.
Or, in [another old project](https://github.com/minagawah/rust-perlin-wasm-test-2),
just to watch floating particles [demo](http://tokyo800.jp/minagawah/rust-perlin-wasm-test-2/).  
:pushpin: `rust` `wasm-pack` `wasm-bindgen` `js-sys` `web-sys` `Perlin Noise`
- [wasm-pack-react-markdown-example](https://github.com/minagawah/wasm-pack-react-markdown-example)  
React app calling WASM to convert markdown texts into HTML (using [comrak](https://crates.io/crates/comrak)).  
:pushpin: `rust` `wasm-pack` `wasm-bindgen` `React` `CRA` `markdown`
